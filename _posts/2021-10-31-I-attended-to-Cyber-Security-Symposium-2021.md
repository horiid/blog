## I Attended to Cyber Security Symposium(CSS) 2021
I attended to [Cyber Security Symposium 2021](https://www.iwsec.org/css/2021/) held on 2021/10/26 to 2021/10/29 and gave a presentation in the CSIRT track on the topic of mutual cooperation  of continuous monitoring on C2 servers. It was my first off-campus presentation so that I was so upset and nervous, but the paper itself got nominated for the [MWS Best Practice Award](http://www.iwsec.org/mws/2021/files/mws2021_trackchair_takata.pdf), we believe that we were able to achieve better results than expected. I will continue our joint research keeping my gratitude for the co-authors from a company for working with me.
