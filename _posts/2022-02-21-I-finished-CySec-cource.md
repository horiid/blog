## I finshed CySec - A course for training Cybersecurity professionals
I finished [CySec - A course for training cybersecurity professionals which consists of seven specialized courses](https://cysec.dendai.ac.jp/about_cysec/). I took various Cybersecurity(CyS) courses ranged from malware analysis/methodology of constructing secure servers and digital forensics to information security management and laws. It also has two courses for CISSP: an international certificate for cybersecurity professionals. I didn't take the exam however, because it costs too much to take the test for students, sadge. I kind of hope if my future employers gladly paid for me to have it. I'm willing to study hard for it if you were eager to.
